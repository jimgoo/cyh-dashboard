          Ketamine has a dissociative effect. This means that it creates a separation of mind and
          body, also commonly referred to as an out of body experience. While ketamine is not a true
          psychedelic, it does have psychedelic properties and creates an altered state of
          consciousness, allowing the mind to be outside of its normal waking status. In this state,
          the mind can access subconscious information. <br />
          <br />‍ Ketamine is a powerful disruptor of limiting beliefs around ourselves and our
          world, allowing one to see themselves truly without all the labels and limitations. It
          often creates a euphoric feeling for people and many people report having a sense of
          oneness and connectedness to others and to something bigger than themselves. Ketamine can
          also allow people to revisit times or memories of trauma and reconsolidate the memories
          around those events in a less painful, fearful or traumatic way.

          Ketamine is a legal medication, originally used for anesthesia. It was developed in the
          1960s and was commonly used in the Vietnam war because it could be used in the field
          safely and effectively. Ketamine does not suppress the respiratory drive or paralyze
          muscles the way other anesthetics do, and its dissociative properties provide for rapid
          pain relief.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‍ Ketamine has been used in mental health for more than 20 years, and as a result we know
          the medicine itself is extremely safe for most individuals. Ketamine is FDA approved for
          anesthesia and treating depression. It’s also used as an off-label medication for pain and
          a variety of mental health conditions. <br />
          <br />‍ Recently, the FDA approved a specific form of intranasal ketamine to be used for
          the indication of treatment resistant depression (TRD). TRD does not have an agreed upon
          definition but typically refers to people who have had an inadequate response from at
          least two antidepressant medications. Using this definition, TRD is relatively common
          given that 50% or more of patients do not achieve an adequate response following
          antidepressant therapy.

          Yes. Ketamine can be used safely with many antidepressant medications. Always discuss

          possible. You can also discuss your options with the clinical team at Choose Ketamine.
